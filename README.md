# SmartSPE – Smart Self & Peer Evaluation Moodle Plugin

A Moodle activity plugin designed to streamline self and peer evaluations for group-based coursework, while incorporating sentiment analysis and statistical analysis to enhance evaluation reliability and lecturer insights.

## 📌 Overview

SmartSPE is a custom Moodle module developed for Murdoch University as a Final Year Project. The plugin allows lecturers to create and manage peer evaluation activities for student group projects.

Students evaluate themselves and their teammates through:

Quantitative Likert-scale questions
Qualitative written comments

The system then performs:

Sentiment analysis on textual comments
Consistency checks between scores and comments
Statistical analysis across evaluations

The goal is to create a more intelligent, fair, and insightful peer evaluation system directly integrated into Moodle.
